    <string name="about_description">Notification Dictionary is an application to display meaning of selected word as
        notification from all apps that support text selection. The app works offline and uses Wiktionary as a database for meanings.
        Wiktionary is an open source project without which this app would not exist. The logo was made possible thanks to liberal Apache
        license of material design icons. Thanks to WikDict project. Thanks to all the open source projects that helped in the application development

    <string name="info1_summary">Store history and favourite words</string>
    <string name="info1_description">History of searches is stored. Words can also be starred from notification to be stored as favourite.
        History and Favourite are accessible from the menu at right top.
        In case of issues due to update please uninstall and try reinstalling the app since it needs database changes.</string>
    <string name="info2_summary">Read meanings aloud as you read</string>
    <string name="info2_description">Enable Read switch at the right top to read aloud meaning of the word when the notification is created.
    There is also read button per notification to read meaning for each word.</string>
    <string name="info3_summary">Copy and share</string>
    <string name="info3_description">Click on meaning to copy. Long press to share meaning with others. Notifications also have button for these actions.</string>
    <string name="info4_summary">Thanks for the support</string>
    <string name="info4_description">The application is open source and free to use. The development is done in my free time apart
        from my day job along with download costs for database files from CDN.
        If you find the app useful please leave a review in Play store and share the app with your friends.
        It will help and encourage me in maintaining the app and adding more features.\n\nPlease grant notification permission
        since the app requires notification permission in Android 13+ to show meanings through notification.
        Thanks for your support.</string>
